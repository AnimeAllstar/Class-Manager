#### Notes
<sub>This was one of the first Java applications I made back when I was in high school (2018-2019). It was made when I had lesser coding experience and the purpose of making it was to learn. I will occasionally clean up the code and use better coding practices to improve its quality. I'd be glad if you create an issue if you find a bug in the code.</sub>
